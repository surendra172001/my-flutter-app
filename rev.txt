#to unstage
git restore --staged names.txt

#number of insertions = number of lines added
#number of delertions = number of lines deleted

#find all commits 
git log

#removing a commit
git reset "commit hash"
=a commit can't be directly removed, since one commit depends on its previous commit.
So if there are n commits and ith commit needs to be deleted then all the commits 
from i to n needs to be unstaged so will have to go to the (i-1)th commit and
then all those unstaged commits will be uncommited and the project will be restored 
to the(i-1)th commit. All those commits from i to n can be preserved using stashing.

#stashing the changes
git stash
=The changes that needs to stashed must be there in staging area.
we don't want to commit the changes but also don't want to lose the 
changes stashing can be done here.

#restore from stash area
git stash pop

#clearing stash area
git add .
git stash clear
=first we again put the changes in the staging area and then
we stash them and finally clear them.


#connecting to the remote repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/surendra172001/my-flutter-app.git
=here remote indicates working with url
=add means we are connecting a new url
=origin means the name of the url we are adding, so its like contact name corresponding to contact number

#pushing the changes to remote connection
git push origin master
=here push indicates send the changes to the url
=origin is the name of the url so data will be sent to url corresponding to name origin
=master is the name of the branch to which we want to send the changes

#head pointer
=So head is the pointer which is pointing to a branch
=And whatever commits we are going to make from now onwards are 
=going to be made inside the branch being pointer by the head.

#making pull request PR
=We should create one new branch for each feature we add or a bug we fix.
=If we don't do that and make all the commits(adding feature or removing bug) on the main branch
=it would become difficult for other people to find the features which I added.
=So the best way is to create a whole new dedicated branch for each feature and then send PR.
=This line is added from the test branch
