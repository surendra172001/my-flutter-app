#removing a commit
git reset "commit hash"
=a commit can't be directly removed, since one commit depends on its previous commit.
So if there are n commits and ith commit needs to be deleted then all the commits 
from i to n needs to be unstaged so will have to go to the (i-1)th commit and
then all those unstaged commits will be uncommited and the project will be restored 
to the(i-1)th commit. All those commits from i to n can be preserved using stashing.

#stashing the changes
git stash
=The changes that needs to stashed must be there in staging area.
we don't want to commit the changes but also don't want to lose the 
changes stashing can be done here.

#restore from stash area
git stash pop

#clearing stash area
git add .
git stash clear
=first we again put the changes in the staging area and then
we stash them and finally clear them.


#connecting to the remote repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/surendra172001/my-flutter-app.git
=here remote indicates working with url
=add means we are connecting a new url
=origin means the name of the url we are adding, so its like contact name corresponding to contact number
